# FAE Learning Projects

This repository documents my learning journey towards becoming a 
Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung.

It contains small practice projects in Java, Python and Web Development.
The focus is on understanding problem solving, structured thinking 
and basic software development concepts.

Each project is intentionally small and simple, but clearly documented.
The goal is learning and continuous improvement.

Technologies used:
- Java (basics, OOP, console applications)
- Python (basic scripting)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This repository will grow step by step during my application phase
and training preparation.
